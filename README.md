# Repository developed for training purposes. 

This repository is developed to give a low level introduction to Data Science. By following CRISP-DM the process of explore, experiment all up to predict are visualised/shown. What's important to know is that there is a underlying presentation which is not included into this repository. 

The notebook 'Clustering_Titanic_training.ipynb' is used to get an introduction into CRISP-DM and clustering.

### Some small extra info:
